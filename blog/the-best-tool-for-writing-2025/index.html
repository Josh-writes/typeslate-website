        <h1 class='text-3xl font-bold'>The Best Tool For Writing 2025</h1>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>The best writing tool for 2025 isn't some new fancy AI tool. It isn't an overpriced piece of single-use electronics. It's not a new flashy word processor. It's something else entirely. It's TypeSlate: a drafting tool whose only purpose is to get out of your way.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>You need a blank space to write. You don't need 10,000 features that one day you might learn. Those components are useful for an editing tool, but when it comes to writing, you need space. You need simplicity. You need guardrails.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>That is why TypeSlate is the perfect tool for writers who want to focus and get their thoughts down onto the page.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>That's all it is: a completely blank full screen in light or dark mode. No copy-paste, no spell check, no font sizes or types. Just write. Put them down, and when you finish a session, the system automatically copies them to the clipboard.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>That's where Scrivener, Word, Obsidian, Substack, or any other program can be used as an editor. Just paste the content from your draft into one of those and clean it up. The most important thing for drafting, though, is simplicity, focus, and lack of distractions.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Nothing on the market does a better job of bricking your computer into a simple word processor than TypeSlate.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>You can set the word count, and the program will not let you out of it until you hit your number.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Want to do a writing sprint? Set the timer and start. The program will notify you when your time is up, and you can't escape until then (you can, but it requires extra steps). You still need some self-discipline.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>The best part is the program keeps up with every word you write—and none of the ones you don't. This tells you exactly how much content you are creating. Even if you load a template or preload copied material from somewhere else (both features available), every session starts at zero, and the program only counts the words you type into it.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>I am confident that if you download TypeSlate and incorporate it into your writing workflow for thirty days, by the end you will have already received $20 in value. Then you can have the program and use it forever. No monthly fees, no risk the company will go under and the service will disappear. No risk the cloud that stores your data will get hacked and you will lose everything. Just your own copy of TypeSlate to write into and keep track of your stats.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>I've written over 100k words in it since I created it. I started this project in January and didn't add the stats until an early beta tester recommended it.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Try it today for free for thirty days. If you don't think it's worth the $20, then don't buy it. It would be cool if you sent me an email to let me know why. I would love to make it better, but you don't even need to do that. You will have honored me by trying my program.</p>
