		<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Flow. It's become a buzzword. I almost don't want to use it. So many gurus use it as a buzzword.  LinkedIn lunatics staging photos on their laptops in chaotic environments talking about how they must channel flow whenever it hits. It's the modern equivalent of synergy. An overused buzzword that has lost  all of  its meaning.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>Experience Flow</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Have you ever experienced it though?  The fleeting feeling where you can't stop doing the work that you are doing and you are making real progress.  The complete focus with no distraction.  It's real. It's being assaulted on all fronts in our modern world. Everything is designed to keep you from focusing on anything that might make your life better.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>That isn't completely true.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>As long as  your life improvements make someone else rich then there may be something out there that improves your life.  The sad truth is everyone is trying to sell you something or get your attention so that they can sell that attention to someone else.  Your attention is valuable.  The human brain is the most powerful computer on earth.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>Human Vs. AI computational abilities</h2>

    <div class="md:float-right md:ml-6 md:mb-4 md:max-w-xs bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-4 shadow-md">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-yellow-900">ðŸŽ¯ Focus Better with TypeSlate</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-yellow-800 mb-3">
        TypeSlate is a fullscreen writing app that locks out distractions and helps you finish what you start.

<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>The AI craze should make that abundantly obvious.  We do basic things without thinking about them.  Just getting out of bed is a complex combination of computational energy that we do with barely a volt.  AI uses cities worth of energy to do the things you can do in a split second with what's  chilin  between your ears.   Itâ€™s  no wonder that everyone wants your  supercomputersâ€™  attention.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Don't give it to them.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>One of the reasons I created this program is to block out all the distractions.  To force myself and anyone else who  choses  to use TypeSlate to be honest.  To be human.  You can't copy and paste into this program.  You can inject text at the  start  but the program does not count those words towards your writing stats.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>TypeSlate for Flow</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>TypeSlate's  stats are  a pure  proof of your writing. It also created a true full screen environment and treats each writing session as its own session.  Meaning when you start a session, if you end it that is it.  You can inject that text back into another  session  but you can't just pick up where you left off.  TypeSlate is designed to encourage you to stay on task and in your flow state until the goal you set for yourself is met.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>A tool designed for deep work</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Deep work is a rare thing in the modern world.  Tools that truly foster it that exist are rare.  Free tools that do it are even rarer.  Download this free tool today.</p>
