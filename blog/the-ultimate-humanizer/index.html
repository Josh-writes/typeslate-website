		<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Itâ€™s  ironicâ€”humans  scouring the internet for robots that can write like humans. Hello? You write like a human. Why do you need a robot to do it for you?</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>The best humanizer on the market is your fingers and a blank page.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>Voice</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>If you want another pile of irony: voice is ineffable. The very thing that can't be said is what we find unique about each person's words. AI can't emulate it. You know when you are reading a human's writing. That is why we created a tool that amplifies it. <a href="/blog/what-is-typeslate/" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800 transition">TypeSlate</a>  gets out of your way and lets you write.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>How AI Muddies the Voice It Claims to Improve</h2>

    <div class="md:float-right md:ml-6 md:mb-4 md:max-w-xs bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-4 shadow-md">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-yellow-900">ðŸŽ¯ Focus Better with TypeSlate</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-yellow-800 mb-3">
        TypeSlate is a fullscreen writing app that locks out distractions and helps you finish what you start.

<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>I've tried and tried to turn AI into a golden goose. I've probably wasted a few cities' worth of computational kWh trying to prompt GPT and Claude to write novels. The number of context files, style guides, scene-by-scene chapter guidesâ€”all to try and make the AI stay on track and not lose the subtleties that kill the collective delusion that is reading fiction. Every single time it fails. It's like it just can't seem to figure it out. By the time I am done editing the novel, I could have written it better myself.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>The Confidence to Trust Your Voice</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Writing is a skill that requires practice. Like physical fitness or studying, it requires time under tension. If you are outsourcing the heavy lifting to an LLM, then you are not putting in the reps you need to get to where you want to be as a writer. Practice in a judgment-free environment. That is what TypeSlate is. It lets your thoughts run free.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>As Rumi says, "We put Jesus in the barn and let the donkey run free in the pasture." Let Jesus run in the pasture. I guess that is where he was going with that metaphor. Either way, you are stifling your creativity by passing off the writing to AI.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>I Built TypeSlate to Forge Forward and Look Back Later</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>I created TypeSlate because I noticed how much momentum was stolen from me when I misspelled a word in a word processor and the spell check kicked in. I wanted to be able to keep going, but my ADD wouldn't let me. I needed to stop and fix it. Well, then I've stopped. The train was derailed, and I might be able to jump back onâ€”but probably not. By the next minute, I was on Chrome checking some stat about something irrelevant.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>TypeSlate makes that much harder to do. While writing this, I've had three impulses to grab my mouse and open another tab. I couldn't, because the  fullscreen  is engaged and there is no tab. Had the tabs been there, I would have stopped and lost focus.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>Writing Is Where Your Voice Learns to Speak</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Stephen King famously said, "Shovel a bunch of shit because under it is gold." Like a sculptor, we need a lot of material to work from. Our writing is an icebergâ€”most of it will never see the light of day.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>So  write your drafts without looking back.</p>
