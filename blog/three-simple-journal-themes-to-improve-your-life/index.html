		<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>Journal: Your Life Depends on It</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>That seems a bit hyperbolic and I will admit that it is. You will live if you don't journal, but journaling will unlock so much of your mental potential. There is something about hurling your thoughts into the void. Bringing them out of nothing and putting them down into reality. Giving your thoughts structure. Forcing your thoughts to go from the abstract, fluid, ephemeral presences they are into tangible, translatable words.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Writing, and by extension journaling, helps you hone your thoughts and ideas. Guided journaling about a specific subject helps you sharpen your thoughts on it. You clarify the thoughts you have and potentially unlock others you didn't know were swimming around up there.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>Three types of journaling that I swear by:</h2>

    <div class="md:float-right md:ml-6 md:mb-4 md:max-w-xs bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-4 shadow-md">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-yellow-900">ðŸŽ¯ Focus Better with TypeSlate</h3>

<h3 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6'>Morning Pages</h3>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Untangle the mess before the day begins This is where my journaling begins. First thing in the morning. The other day I sat down to write and I heard, "Pick me up." I turned around and my adorable two-year-old son was standing next to my computer.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'><em>5:30 a.m.!</em></p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>If that becomes a pattern I am going to lose my mind. It felt like I lost my mind. It felt like my mind didn't get a chance to untangle itself. That is exactly what the morning pages do. They untangle the mess that is  your  mind. By the end of the 750 words, I've honed what I want to accomplish for the day. I take this a step further by utilizing  <a href="/blog/what-makes-typeslate-different/" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800 transition">TypeSlate's</a>   autocopy  to clipboard and I paste my journal session into ChatGPT and it helps me create a plan of attack.</p>
<h3 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6'>Gratitude Journal</h3>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Start grounded with what's good This one keeps me grounded. It reminds me how great life is. Sometimes it's simple stuff like the clear sky and the temperate weather, and other times it's when a diagnosis scare turns out benign. Either way, expressing gratitude first thing in the morning reminds me that life is good and there are so many things I am grateful for. Putting the grateful foot forward is an excellent way to start your day.</p>
<h3 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6'>Stressors</h3>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Write the weight off your shoulders This is one of the most practical journaling I do. I sit and stare at the blank page and then write about anything that causes me anxiety. Anything weighing heavy on my mind, I write it down. I elaborate on it. I don't try to solve it or fix the problem. I don't stop the journaling session. I just write them all down. Then move on to the next one. Then I paste the results in GPT and it helps me organize the list of actionable things I can do to alleviate the stress.</p>
<h3 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6'>Bonus: Brainstorming</h3>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Let the creative floodgates open .  This is another  journaling technique  I  enjoy  when  start  a new project. Whether it's a book and I want to brainstorm the plot and the world, or a coding project or website.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'><em>I riff.</em></p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>Write down anything that comes to mind. Sometimes jumping from one thing to another without finishing my thoughts. Just let the thoughts flow out. Get out of their way.  When I finish ,  I let an AI untangle the mess and make sense of it all.</p>
<h2 class='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8'>Journal, your good life depends on it</h2>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>I guess my closing argument  isnâ€™t  as hyperbolic as my opening one. I will say that you will  improve  your quality of life by reflecting on it and fleshing out the tangled thoughts that rattle around up there.</p>
<p class='text-base text-gray-700'>It just so happens that I've created the perfect tool for journaling. This on e and the best part: itâ€™s free . Try these journaling sessions and I dare you to say that it hasn't improved your life.</p>
