    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">May 2025 · By Josh — Creator of TypeSlate</p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      TypeSlate is not a word processor. It's a word capturer. It's not meant to open existing files and edit them, correct grammar or spelling, or format it to publish. TypeSlate exists for you to have a blank page to sit down and write.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base text-gray-700">
      It's designed to give you complete freedom. No icons, spellcheck, or notifications, just you and the words you put on the page. Because it is a minimal word capturer, it has features that a word processor doesn't have.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">1. Auto Copy to Clipboard</h2>
    <p>
      I use this feature the most. Because of this feature, I haven't opened a single txt file. I edit my writing in Word or Scrivener. The beauty of the auto copy to clipboard tool is when I finish writing in TypeSlate I can paste the content anywhere I want by simple right clicking and pressing paste.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">2. Templates</h2>
    <p>
      This feature allows you to work from a txt file that you've already started without skewing your word counts. Every session starts at zero no matter what the session content starts as. This feature allows you to brainstorm story outlines, answer questionnaires, or copy the last paragraph of your manuscript and have it at the top of the recent session as a reference. It's my vision that we can create unique templates and share with each other. Fun writing prompts and pre-made outlines.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">3. Writing Stats</h2>
    <p>
      We can all track our word counts through various ways. Many people keep a spreadsheet for this purpose. Why not write in a program that only counts the words you put on the page? Using TypeSlate as a first pass drafting tool allows you to see how many words you are writing daily, weekly, and monthly and total averages and your running average.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">4. Community Leaderboard</h2>
    <p>
      Proud of the volume you are producing? Share it with the community. Submitting your stats to the community is simple. Soon the Leaderboard will be live on the website.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">5. Word Count and Timer Mode</h2>
    <p>
      These two features are great for those of us that want to build up our discipline. Every morning, I set the word-count to 750 and select the folder "Morning Journal" and write. The timer mode is great for writing sprints. If you are working up your fiction muscle, using the timer is the best way to do that. It's built into the program.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base text-gray-700">
      These are five features that make TypeSlate unique as a Word Capturer. They are features you cannot get with a word processor. Try it for yourself. It's free for 30 days and then you only pay once.
