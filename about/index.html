        <p>I sat down to write one day during my lunch break. I have a very limited window of time to create. I opened Chrome and‚Äîbam‚Äîhalf an hour passed. Lunch was over, and I never even found the Google Doc I meant to write in.</p>
        <p>By the time I realized, I had checked my emails, my KDP royalties, my Medium account, my Substack notifications, and my Google Search Console. My break was gone.</p>
        <p>I said to myself, ‚ÄúI wish I could <em>brick</em> my computer and turn it into a true blank page to write on.‚Äù</p>
        <p>That‚Äôs how TypeSlate was born.</p> 		
        <p>When I started, I knew nothing about coding. I had a vision for the program I wanted, and I knew what features it should have. That vision sent me on a long road: learning how to write Python, how to collaborate with AIs to build and refine code, and how to manage files, libraries, and databases.</p>
		<p>Every morning, I opened the latest version of my blank page and hurled thousands of words at it.</p>
        <p>The catharsis of simplicity guided the entire build. It became my first principle. Every time I added a feature, I‚Äôd stop and use the program to write‚Äîreal writing, not just testing. Over the past six months, I‚Äôve written over 100,000 words in TypeSlate. Likely more, since I didn‚Äôt start tracking word counts until a month or two in. I didn‚Äôt add backup support until the fourth month.</p>

		</div><p>And now here it is: my writing program.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm very proud of it. It‚Äôs minimal in all the right ways, and it includes features I‚Äôve never seen anywhere else. I‚Äôm honored you‚Äôre here reading this, and I‚Äôd be even more honored if you gave TypeSlate a try for 30 days. If you don‚Äôt see the value, I completely understand if you choose not to continue.</p>
        <p>I hate monthly subscriptions. The last thing I wanted was to nickel and dime other writers. That‚Äôs why TypeSlate is a one-time payment. You‚Äôll get the program‚Äîand all future updates‚Äîforever.</p>
        <p>Thanks again for reading about me and my project. I hope to see your stats on the leaderboard soon.</p>
